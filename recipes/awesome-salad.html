    <h1>Awesome Pasta Salad</h1>
    <img src="./awesome-salad.jpg" alt="A photo of a super duper awesome pasta salad">
    <p>This pasta salad with pepperoni, tomatoes, and provolone cheese is the best I've ever eaten, and people request it frequently. It's a very easy, light-tasting side dish for a picnic or dinner.</p>
